---------------------------------- INTRODUCTION ------------------------------------------------
Source information for the analysis is a 3D system of balls
(atoms) {A}, where each ball is defined by its Cartesian coordinates
and its radius.

Balls do not intersect each
other.

We do not consider cases when one ball is
located entirely within another one.

An empty sphere can be tangent simultaneously to no more than
four balls of the system.  
	- four balls enouth to determine position and radius of another ball
	- in real life its almost impossible that 4 balls touch another one at the
	same time

System has no borders

We assume that system {A} does not contain small
balls in the narrow gap between a pair of larger balls.

----------------------------GEOMETRICAL CONFIGURATIONS (2,3,4 balls)-------------

The geometric locus of points, equidistant from the surfaces of
two balls i and j, is defined as Voronoi S-surface (Voronoi
bisector, Voronoi hyperboloid) Hij.

Geometric locus of points equidistant from the surfaces of three
balls i, j, k is defined as Voronoi S-channel and is denoted as
Cijk.
It may be represented as a trajectory of movement of the
center of an empty sphere (with a dynamic radius) simultaneously
tangent to this set of three balls.
S-channel is the common line of intersection of all the three Voronoi
hyperboloids (Hij, Hik, and Hjk) of pairs of these balls.

Properties of s-channel:
	Voronoi S-channel is simply-connected line. It can be
	either nonclosed, i.e., with endpoints extended into infinity, or
	closed.
	For equal balls, Voronoi S-channel is apparently a
	straight line
	
Three types of s-channel configurations may be distinguished:
	1. Planar, with nonclosed channel; 
	2. Nonplanar, with closed channel, without a tangential plane. 
	3. Configurations without S-channel.
	
Bottleneck is the point, where radius of s-channel is minimal or maximal (apperently).

A set of four balls in space specifically fixes the empty sphere tangent
to all four balls in the space enclosed by the four balls.
The center of this sphere is defined as Voronoi S-vertex for the given set of four
spheres. Vijkl
- s-vertex is a point

S-vertex property: 
	Exactly four Voronoi S-channels intersect in each Voronoi
	S-vertex. 
	
There exist three principally different types of configurations of
sets of fours balls.They are determined by the number of empty
spheres that can be tangent to the balls of the given set of four:
	1. Configurations of the first type (one inscribed sphere, one Voronoi
	S-vertex) will be denoted as singlet.
	
	2. An example of a configuration with two inscribed empty
	spheres would be the location of a relatively small ball between
	a triplet of large balls
	
	Configurations of the third type (see Fig. 4c) are obtained when relatively small
	balls ‘‘hide’’ from each other at different sides of the big one.
 
----------------------------GEOMETRICAL CONFIGURATIONS (many balls)-------------

Voronoi S-Region - a region of space whose points are closer to the surface of a
given ball than to the surfaces of other balls of this system.

General Properties of Voronoi S-Network:
	1.Each site of Voronoi S-network is a center of an interstitial sphere
	determining Delaunay S-simplex in the given system of balls.
	2. Exactly four bonds converge in each site of Voronoi S-network.
	3. Each bond of the Voronoi S-network is a fairway on the way between
	 the neighboring sites.

----------------------------REPRESENTATION-----------------------------------------------------

Coordinates of the sites of the network are recorded in an 2D array
		D(1 to 3; 1 to nD)
		
An integer array is required for recording the connectivity of
the network sites (also 2D array)
		DD(1 to 4; 1 to nD):
		
For every site we should record
numbers of four corresponding balls
		DA(1 to 4; 1 to nD)
